PROJECT STATEMENT

Problem Statement

Electrical calculations such as determining equivalent resistance, converting between Star  and Delta resistor networks, calculating electric power, and analyzing basic AC circuits often require repetitive mathematical steps. Students and beginners frequently struggle with these computations, especially when solving circuit problems manually.
This project aims to simplify these processes by providing an interactive Python-based calculator that performs these calculations quickly and accurately.

Scope of the project

The scope of this project includes developing a command-line application that can:

-Calculate equivalent resistance for series and parallel circuits.
-Convert resistor arrangements between Star (Y) and Delta (Δ) configurations.
-Compute electrical power using voltage or current inputs.
-Perform basic AC circuit analysis for RLC circuits by computing impedance and RMS current.
-Provide a menu-driven interface that guides users through various computational modules.

The project focuses on simplifying electrical calculations rather than simulating complex circuits or providing graphical schematics.
